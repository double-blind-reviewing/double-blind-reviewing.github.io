# Double-blind reviewing status of computer science conferences

This document tracks the status of major computer science conferences
(currently defined as those listed in [CSrankings](http://csrankings.org)) with
respect to how they maintain anonymity during the reviewing process;
it is curated by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com). For additions or updates,
please post an issue or pull request [on its GitHub repository](https://github.com/double-blind-reviewing/double-blind-reviewing.github.io).

For the purposes of this document:

* _Single-blind_ means that author identities and affiliations are
visible to reviewers at all points during the reviewing process, while
reviewer identities are hidden from authors.

* _At least partially double-blind_ means that author identities and
affiliations are not revealed to reviewers for papers prior to the
submission of _initial_ paper reviews, and reviewer identities are
hidden from authors.

* _Fully double-blind_ means that "double-blind to accept" is
employed. That is, author identities and affiliations are not revealed
to reviewers until the conclusion of the PC meeting, and only for
accepted papers (including conditionally-accepted papers, pending
modifications due to shepherding).

* _arXiv restricted_ means that submissions to
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or other pre-print servers are
  restricted for at least a limited period before and during the
  review process. When appropriate, there is a link to the CFP or other
  relevant document.

Each conference is linked to its call for papers (CFP) or similar.
In cases where the CFP does not explicitly state the use of blind
reviewing (or whether it is fully double-blind or not), this status has
been verified directly with the program chair(s).

  * (*): ISCA 2020's industrial track (not research track) papers are single-blind.
  * (**): CHI's research paper track has a single meta-reviewer who knows the identities of all authors.
  * (1): Authors are discouraged from posting the submitted work on arXiv or a similar site immediately before or after submitting to the conference.
  * (2): "We do not discourage authors to put their submission on arXiv, but we strongly encourage authors to not put the work on arXiv around (within 1 week) or shortly after (within 1 month) the submission deadline, because potential reviewers may be subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers."
  * (3): "You should not [...] post your work on ArXiV or a similar site just before or after submitting to the conference."
  * (4): Information about arXiv submission  must be provided on the submission form â€“ the PC chair will make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review.
  * (5): "You may post to mailing lists, arxiv, social media, or another publicity channel about your work, but do not mention where the paper is submitted and do not use the exact, as-submitted title in the posting."
  * (6): "While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the reviewing process)."
  * (7): "If available online (e.g., via arXiv) and not anonymous, their titles and abstract must be sufficiently different from the submission"
