# Double-blind reviewing status of computer science conferences

This document tracks the status of major computer science conferences
(currently defined as those listed in [CSrankings](http://csrankings.org)) with
respect to how they maintain anonymity during the reviewing process;
it is curated by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com). For additions or updates,
please post an issue or pull request [on its GitHub repository](https://github.com/double-blind-reviewing/double-blind-reviewing.github.io).

For the purposes of this document:

* _Single-blind_ means that author identities and affiliations are visible
to reviewers at all points during the reviewing process, while reviewer identities
are hidden from authors.

* _At least partially double-blind_ means that author identities and
affiliations are not revealed to reviewers for papers prior to the submission of
_initial_ paper reviews, and reviewer identities are hidden from authors.

* _Fully double-blind_ means that "double-blind to accept" is
employed. That is, author identities and affiliations are not
revealed to reviewers until the conclusion of the PC meeting, and
only for accepted papers (including conditionally-accepted papers,
pending modifications due to shepherding).

Each conference is linked to its call for papers (CFP) or similar.
In cases where the CFP does not explicitly state the use of blind
reviewing (or whether it is fully double-blind or not), this status has
been verified directly with the program chair(s).

  * (*): ISCA 2020's industrial track (not research track) papers are single-blind.
  * (**): CHI's research paper track has a single meta-reviewer who knows the identities of all authors.
